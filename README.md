Introduction
Detection of treatment types in dental panoramic radiographs is still an open problem as the position of the tooth are arbitrarily oriented and usually closely packed. In this work, we optimized a single-stage anchor-free deep learning model to detect and classify the teeth with or without treatment. Our aim is to detect dental restoration, root canal treatment (RCT), and teeth without treatment accurately in a full scan of dental pano-ramic radiographs. We trained our model on 500 images and tested it on 93 images from a dataset of 593 dental panoramic x-rays. The proposed work performance on overall dental treatment detection with an average precision (AP)of 85%. The result of this study suggest-ed that RCT was recognized and predicted with the highest accuracy of 91% AP score.
